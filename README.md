# PyDex
Simple GUI-based Pok√©dex written in Python. Doesn't really have much to it. Can be built by any operating system with relative ease, therefore the Releases section will be empty. However, this has only been tested on a M-chip Mac device.

# Requirements
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (install the latest version)
2. pyinstaller (Once Python is installed, run `pip install pyinstaller` in your Terminal)

# Instructions
1. `git clone` this repository
2. `cd` to the directory on your computer
3. `make` or `make release`
4. `cd dist/PyDex/`
5. `./PyDex`

# Usage
Type a number between 1 and 1017, press Enter/Return on your keyboard or click "Search". As simple as that. I don't think it needs to be any harder. :P
